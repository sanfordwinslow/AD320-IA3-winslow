This assignment requires:
- an HTML file with 5 <div> elements. Those elements should all have unique ID attributes and be visible on the page to start. (Tip: set borders or background colors on empty divs)

- a JS file that has a minimum of 5 functions that perform some DOM manipulation of the 5 <div> elements. All javascript code should be included in the external js file. Your only script tag should be to import the external javascript into your html file. 

- An eventListener should be used for every div. You must use the javascript addEventListener method NOT the html attributes; eg. onclick, onload, etc...
