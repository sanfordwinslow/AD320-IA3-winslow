This assignment requires:
- an HTML file with 5 <div> elements. Those elements should all have unique ID attributes and be visible on the page to start. (Tip: set borders or background colors on empty divs)

- a JS file that has a minimum of 5 functions that perform some DOM manipulation of the 5 <div> elements. All javascript code should be included in the external js file. Your only script tag should be to import the external javascript into your html file. 

- An eventListener should be used for every div. You must use the javascript addEventListener method NOT the html attributes; eg. onclick, onload, etc... 

1. When you mouse over the object, the color will change and the text will change to say Thank you

3. When you change the browser size, the resize event will trigger
